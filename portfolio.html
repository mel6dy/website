    <h1 style="color:#f2eacf; ">This program essentially lets the user grow their own garden. There are four flowers in total, and the user is able to customize each flower's color to their liking. The progam was built using many methods that we learned in this unit such as for loops, while loops, and lists. Once all four flowers are grown, the user is met with a happy rainbow :)</h1>

    <br>
    <h1 style="color:#f2eacf; ">This game is a cooking game where the user gets to choose between a steak and a burger. We made this scratch program by utilizing the costumes feature on Scratch which changed the costume of the meat when it "cooked." We also added a timer on the burger, and included more than one background for the kitchen and welcome screen. The broadcast funciton was really useful in the creation process as that was how we communicated to the program which food the player picked and whenever they finished each step.</h1>
