    <h1 style="color:#f2eacf; ">This program essentially lets the user grow their own garden. There are four flowers in total, and the user is able to customize each flower's color to their liking. The progam was built using many methods that we learned in this unit such as for loops, while loops, and lists. Once all four flowers are grown, the user is met with a happy rainbow :)</h1>
